                <h2 className="text-3xl mb-5">I'm a software developer with a passion for unique design and functionality.</h2>
                <p className="text-md mb-2">Hi, I'm Emmanuel Alabi, a college-level software developer currently coding from Rwanda. I work with a wide range of technologies, especially those built upon Javascript (React, Vue, Next.js) and Python (Django, Flask), as well as no-code and low-code tools like Supabase, Firebase, Webflow, and Flutterflow. I'm a high school graduate, I have certifications from Harvard, IBM, and freeCodeCamp, and I'm currently persuing a BSc in Computer Science.</p>
                <p className="text-md mb-2">I enjoy creating applications for everyday people. I also enjoy writing about coding tips and tricks, experiences and cheesy humor on my blog. When I'm not doing any of those, or being overwhelmed by university work, you'll most likely find me playing videogames, or closely watching my favorite eSports series. I also enjoy writing fiction, cycling and playing badmington. I have an interest but not a nessecarily large expertise in graphic design, game development, and 3D rendering.</p>
                <p className="text-md mb-2">I'm always available for collaboration projects or gigs. Feel free to reach out to me on the contact page with any of those, or just to say hi. You can also take a look at what I'm good at on the projects page.</p>
                <p className="text-md mb-2">Peace!</p>
